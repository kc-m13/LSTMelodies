# Project Description

LTSMelodies - Creating Music with LSTM Neural Networks

LTSMelodies is an exploration into the realm of artificial creativity, where neural networks harmonize with human ingenuity to craft mesmerizing melodies.With LTSMelodies, we unlock the potential of AI to compose original pieces that captivate and inspire. The project makes use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks and is implemented using the Keras library in Python, to generate music compositions.
